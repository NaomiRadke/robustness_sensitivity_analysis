These csv data files contain bias corrected CMIP5 projections from the
ISIMIP2 Fast Track project (https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/details/10)
extracted for the following point: lon=9.30, lat=49.42. Each file contains
daily precipitation (mm), average temperature (degC), maximum temperature
(degC), and minimum temperature (degC) from 1950-2099 for a single CMIP5
model realization. There are 20 total model realizations (5 CMIP5 models with
4 RCP forcing scenarios). Included CMIP5 models:

1.) GFDL-ESM2M r1i1p1
2.) HadGEM2-ES r1i1p1
3.) IPSL-CM5A-LR r1i1p1
4.) MIROC-ESM-CHEM r1i1p1
5.) NorESM1-M r1i1p1
